<h1>Json Class</h1>

 ### Amuch simpler and nicer way to deal with json data.

<h2>Description</h2>
Tired of having to write open(filepath,write or read) as file and then json.dumps everytime you want to save data to a json object? Then look no further than this JSON class object I created. All you have to do each time you modify your json data is use the .save() method made in this class to deal with opening and writing to the file for you.
